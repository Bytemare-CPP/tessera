# Tessera
Tessera is a mobile app designed to facilitate in-person social connections using NFC technology and selfies. Instead of passive social media engagement, Tessera encourages meaningful interactions by allowing users to:

ðŸ“Œ Tap phones to connect using NFC
ðŸ“Œ Take a selfie together to capture the moment
ðŸ“Œ View a home feed of recent connections

The app focuses on authentic, real-world interactions, making networking and socializing more engaging. Future features include group connections, profile customization, and notifications.

ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack:

    Frontend: React Native (Expo), React Native NFC Manager, React Native Camera
    Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime), Node.js + Express (optional)
    Collaboration: GitHub Projects, GitHub Issues, Slack/Discord

ðŸš€ Development Approach:
We use iterative development with weekly sprints, starting with an MVP and expanding as time allows.
