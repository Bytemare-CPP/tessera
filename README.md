# Tessera
Tessera is a mobile app designed to facilitate in-person social connections using NFC technology and selfies. Instead of passive social media engagement, Tessera encourages meaningful interactions by allowing users to:

ðŸ“Œ Tap phones to connect using NFC
ðŸ“Œ Take a selfie together to capture the moment
ðŸ“Œ View a home feed of recent connections

The app focuses on authentic, real-world interactions, making networking and socializing more engaging. Future features include group connections, profile customization, and notifications.
